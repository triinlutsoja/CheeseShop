# CheeseShop
This is a simple shop application for a cheese shop. This is a task given to me at the Wotech reskilling course.

My intelliJ Ultimate trial was about and I needed to submit my work as it is.

As of July 3rd 2024 the application is not final yet:

* Under CheeseShop the method addPurchaseHistory is unfinished. The idea was to call the method inside checkOut(Customer customer).
* I also intended to add the functionality to save the current cart over multiple sessions until it's cleared or purchased.
* A clearConsole() would be a bonus inbetween action choices.
